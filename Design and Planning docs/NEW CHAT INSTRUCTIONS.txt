Colyseus rooms can definitely handle a 25x25 map state. Our current Arena system using Colyseus is solid foundation to build upon. I'll start the new chat by:

Reviewing our current Colyseus Arena implementation
Identifying where we need to modify the matchmaking to wait for 8 players
Examining how to structure our 25x25 map state within the Colyseus Schema system
Planning how to integrate our new spawning/exploration phase

The key thing to note is that Colyseus's state synchronization system is very efficient and can easily handle:

625 tile states (25x25)
8 player states
Monster states
Item/loot states
Environmental changes (like flooding)



The immediate implementation goals:

Modify Arena system to require 8 players before starting
Implement player spawning at designated East/West positions
Set up basic tile system and movement simulation
Create initial exploration phase before combat
