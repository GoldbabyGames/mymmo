Phase 1 (0-5 mins):
- All water channels (~) are shallow
- Movement penalty: 20% slower
- Can cross freely

Phase 2 (5-10 mins):
- Outer ring begins flooding
- Tiles flood in sequence from outside
- Every 30 seconds:
  - New outer tile floods
  - Flooded tile damage: 5% max HP/second
  - Forces movement inward
  
Phase 3 (10-15 mins):
- Middle ring floods
- Increased flood damage: 10% max HP/second
- Only central chambers and immediate approaches safe
- Creates urgency for final confrontations
