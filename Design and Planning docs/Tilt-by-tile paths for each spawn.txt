P1 (SE) Primary Path:
- Start â†’ Monster Den (20% combat chance)
- Move SW through 3 regular tiles
- Encounter Loot Room L1 (guaranteed loot)
- Cross water channel (slow movement)
- Access Junction X1
- Progress toward Central chambers

Similarly structured paths for each spawn but with variations:
P2 (NE): Mirror of P1 southward
P3/P4 (E): Direct westward paths
P5/P6 (W): Direct eastward paths
P7 (SW): Mirror of P2 northward
P8 (NW): Mirror of P1 southward

Deviation Logic:
- Each tile has "weight" for next movement
- Base: 70% chance follow primary path
- 20% chance explore adjacent tile
- 10% chance backtrack (reduced each time)
